## iOS apps Countries using ChatGPT 4.o3-mini, ChatGPT

 A simple iOS application Countries, which shows all the countries of the World by region (Europe, Asia, Latin America, etc.) 
 and for each country its name and flag. 
 
 If you select a country, then additional information about the population 
 and the size of GDP (gross domestic product) gdp and the country's location on the World map is reported.
 We used World Bank data, but we did not tell the AI ​​either the sites or the data structures, 
 the AI ​​should find all this itself and use them when creating an iOS application.
